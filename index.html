      <h2>Full-Stack Web Developer | 11 years Mainframe Development | Enterprise Solutions | Career Re-Entry in Tech</h2>
      <p>
        Technology has always been my language. I bring 11 years of experience in Mainframe development within the insurance and banking industries, proficient in COBOL, JCL, VSAM, and DB2 SQL, delivering enterprise-grade solutions and leading cross-functional teams.
      </p>
       <p>
        To expand my expertise into modern web technologies, I recently completed an intensive Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp.
         During this program, I built the “Gild & Thread” Full-Stack E-Commerce Capstone Project, simulating a modern online marketplace with user and admin workflows using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, and JWT authentication. </p>
      <p>
        I’m now excited to re-enter the tech industry, combining my legacy system expertise with modern web development skills. I thrive on solving complex problems, collaborating with teams, and building solutions that bridge enterprise systems with today’s digital technologies.      </p>
